    "# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "Introduction to different OOP concepts\n",
    "### Why OOP?\n",
    "OOP offers several advantages if implemented properly:\n",
    "- **Code reusability**: It becomes easy to reuse our code in other programs\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Can hide the complexity of the code, and only expose what's relevant. Main benefits:\n",
    "  - Access to our objects from other code is simplified (no need to understand the whole code, just the funcitonalities that are exposed)\n",
    "  - Users can't modify values they shouldn't be modifying\n",
    "- **Modularity**: OOP shines the most in large projects, but needs proper planing. With that, our code can be written in small pieces, which makes it simpler to develope large projects.\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: Programs written using OOP are (in general) easier to maintain, modify and extend than, for instance, procedural programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of OOP\n",
    "- **Size / [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code)**: In some languages, there's a lot of extra code that needs to be added for simple things. A typical example could be the [Java helloworld](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beginning-java-programming-with-hello-world-example/).\n",
    "- **Requires more planning**: Implementing OOP the right way is not easy, and requires a lot of planning. Failing to do so usually results in code that is hard to understand, debug and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary / general concepts\n",
    "- **Method**: \"method\" is just a synonym for \"function\". Example: a \"start\" method in a \"Vehicle\" class.\n",
    "- **Attribute, field, member (sometimes: property)**:  These terms are often mixed and different languages and people tend to use it with slightly different meanings. In general, they refer to a variable that belongs to an object, but in the case of properties, they often refer to methods that \"hide\" the access to variables (and in that case, these methods are called *accessors*, or *getters and setters*. Example: a \"name\" attribute in a \"Person\" class. \n",
    "- **static (or class)** method / variable / attribute..: They refer to a method / variable / attribute / etc that doesn't belong to any specific object, but to the class itself. Example: an \"AVAILABLE_COLORS\" class variable in a \"Vehicle\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes, objects, interfaces\n",
    "**IMPORTANT** Different languages might use a slightly different notation, especially for the \"object\" part, but are basically the same across most languages. Sometimes you might also find that the languages lacks support for interfaces (e.g. Python) or that it extends the concept (e.g. [Traits in Scala](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_traits.htm)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes and objects\n",
    "A **class** can be seen as a template that you will instantiate to create **objects** from it. In this template, you define variables and methods that will be available in your objects (often called attributes, properties, fields..) but you also define methods and variables that belong to the class itself (often called class variables or static methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an object from a class, some languages define a special method called a **constructor**. In Python, this method is the ```__init__``` method. In Python, this method (and any method that belongs to the object) takes a special, extra argument, ```self```. This ```self``` argument is nothing else that the object being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this could be a class definition, including the constructor:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Unit:\n",
    "    # These are class variables, also known as \"static variable\" in other languages\n",
    "    # It doesn't belong to an instance, so to access it, you have to use \"Unit.VAR_NAME\"\n",
    "    UNIT_TYPE_RANGED = 'ranged'\n",
    "    UNIT_TYPE_MELEE  = 'melee'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # This constructor takes four parameters\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name: str, unit_type: str, attack: int, defense:int):\n",
    "        # Here we set the value of the attributes in our object\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.unit_type = unit_type\n",
    "        self.attack = attack\n",
    "        self.defense = defense\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # This is an instance (object) method\n",
    "    def take_damage(self, amount: int):\n",
    "        self.defense -= amount\n",
    "        if (self.defense <= 0):\n",
    "            print(f\"{self.name}: I've been destroyed!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # This is a class method. To call it, you do it the same way as for variables: Unit.method_name\n",
    "    # Notice how there is no \"self\" provided here.\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def unit_types() -> List[str]:\n",
    "        return [Unit.UNIT_TYPE_RANGED, Unit.UNIT_TYPE_MELEE]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is how we would instantiate an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# We create a unit of type \"archer\"\n",
    "archer = Unit(name=\"archer\", unit_type=Unit.UNIT_TYPE_RANGED, attack=5, defense=2)\n",
    "# Now we create a unit of type \"swordsman\"\n",
    "swordsman = Unit(name=\"swordsman\", unit_type=Unit.UNIT_TYPE_MELEE, attack=4, defense=4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interfaces\n",
    "Interfaces are not supported or directly available in all languages, but are still a very powerful tool to know and leverage when possible. In short, an interface defines a \"contract\", that guarantees that any class implementing that interface will have a predefined set of methods defined, and that other programs / classes can use safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In Python there are not interfaces as such. Instead, you can create classes with *abstract* methods. An abstract method is a function that is defined but not implemented, and that any child class MUST implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - no interface."
