    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is what's called a \"programming paradigm\", or in other words: it's just a way to structure and organize your code to make sure it's easy to maintain it, and to enable collaboration between different people.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, OOP tries to model our problem by splitting it into smaller components that interact with each other. Usually, these \"components\" represent concrete ideas (e.g. a person, a car, a bank) and their relationships (e.g. an insurance, a loan, an owner...)."

    "## Classes and Instances (Objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of OOP we have classes and instances (a.k.a. objects). You can see a class as a \"blueprint\" that defines how something behaves and what properties it has. For instance, we could have a class \"Person\", that contains properties \"name\" and \"age\", and that has the method \"say_hello\". Note that at this point, this is just a general definition, there's no concrete \"person\" yet. In contrast, an **instance** or **object** is a concrete instantiation of a class. So, you could have a class \"Person\", and an instance of the person class representing \"John Doe\", and another instance representing \"Jane Doe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you define classes with the ```class``` reserved keyword, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an empty \"blueprint\", but this still doesn't have any properties or methods. We will first learn how to define attributes for your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initializing your class: the ```__init__``` method\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you initialize the properties of your instance in a special method, named ```__init__```. In software development, this method is called a **constructor**. For our ```Person``` class, where we want to have a ```name``` and ```age``` attributes, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that's specific to Python is the first argument you see in this method, the ```self``` method, which must be the first argument of any instance method (we'll cover this more in detail below). The other two variables passed to the ```__init__``` method, ```name``` and ```age``` are just values that will be provided when creating an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, inside the method you see statements like ```self.name = name```. This is adding a \"name\" attribute to the instance, so that you can access it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the class we just defined, we can create instances like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "john = Person(name=\"John\", age=30)\n",
    "jane = Person(name=\"Jane\", age=35)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Hi there, I'm {john.name} and I'm {john.age}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Hi there, I'm {jane.name} and I'm {jane.age}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes we just created here are called **instance attributes**, because they are specific to each instance of the Person class; the value is not shared between instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes: Class and instance attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you want to have a value that's shared among all the instances of a class. Suppose that you want to have an attribute to know how many Person instances you have created. You could do something like this:"

    "\n",

Besides, when we access it, we use the class name (```Person```) instead of ```self```. You will still be able to use ```self``` in other methods, but if you do it inside the ```__init__```, a new instance attribute would be created, so it is advisable to use the class name when accessing class attributes.\n",
