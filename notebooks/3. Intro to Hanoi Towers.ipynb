    "In this notebook, we'll present a relatively simple problem, for which we'll be implementing an initial solution that we'll keep improving through the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you have three towers and a set of N discs of different sizes, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Towers of Hanoi - Source](../images/tower_of_hanoi_start.jpg \"Towers of Hanoi - Source\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to move all discs from tower \"S\" (source) to tower \"D\" (destination), while we have an intermediary tower \"I\" that we can use as a temporary or buffer. So this is where you want to end:\n",

    "![Towers of Hanoi - Destination](../images/tower_of_hanoi_end.jpg \"Towers of Hanoi - Destination\")\n",

    "That's easy, right? Well, you have to do so while following a few rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can only move one disc at a time\n",
    "- You can only put a disc on top of a disc that's bigger. For instance, disc \"3\" can go on top of disc \"5\", but not on top of disc \"1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**\n",
    "- In some books / articles, the goal is defined as moving from A to C, A to B, etc... The important idea is that we have one \"source\" tower, one \"desstination\" tower, and one \"auxiliary\" tower."

    "## Problem definition\n",
    "Let's try to structure the problem a bit. We have:\n",
    "- Three towers: S (source), D (destination) and I (auxiliary)\n",
    "- The starting point or state:\n",
    "  - N discs (1 to N), all on the S tower, and sorted so that disc N is the lowest one, and disc 1 is on top of the tower.\n",
    "- The desired final state:\n",
    "  - All N discs are in the D tower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The constraints we mentioned above:\n",
    "  - You can only move one disc at a time\n",
    "  - You can't place a disc on top of another disc that's smaller.\n",

    "## Solving the problem\n",

    "To help figuring out the algorithm to solve the problem, let's check a few cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### One disc (N=1)\n",
    "- This one's trivial: we just need to move the disc from S to D.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two discs\n",
    "- Move disc 1 from S to I\n",
    "- Move disc 2 from S to D\n",
    "- Move disc 1 from I to D\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three discs\n",
    "- Move disc 1 from S to D\n",
    "- Move disc 2 from S to I\n",
    "- Move disc 1 from D to I\n",
    "- Move disc 3 from S to D\n",
    "- Move disc 1 from I to S\n",
    "- Move disc 2 from I to D\n",
    "- Move disc 1 from S to D\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Check at the last three steps of the process with three disks. Doesn't it look similar to the process for two discs? What about the first three steps?\n",

    "- Move the remaining disc from S to D.\n",
