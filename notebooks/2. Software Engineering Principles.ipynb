    "- **S**: Single responsibility principle\n",
    "  - A class should only have one reason to change, only one \"responsibility\".\n",
    "  - This translates to:\n",
    "    - In general, try to have smaller classes.\n",
    "    - If to change one small feature you need to change multiple classes, you might be breaking this principle.\n",
    "    - If to change multiple features that are not totally related you need to change the same class, you're probably breaking this principle to.\n",
    "      - E.g. If you have a class that handles both saving your data to a file, and also printing the data to stdout, and generating the view of the data in HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O**: Open/closed principle\n",
    "  - Open for extension, closed for modification: You should be able to extend a class’s behavior, without modifying it.\n",
    "- **L**: Liskov's substitution law\n",
    "  - Functions using base classes must be able to use derived classes without knowing it.\n",
    "  - This translates to: If something is working for class \"Vehicle\", it should still work for classes \"Motorbike\", \"Car\" or \"Truck\", assuming they inherit from Vehicle.\n",
    "  - Another way to simplify it: If some of your child classes is overriding a method from the parent class and just leaving it empty or raising an exception, you're probably breaking this principle.\n",
    "- **I**: Interface segregation principle\n",
    "  - Have smaller interfaces, which will enhance reusability.\n",
    "  - This is basically the same thing as the Single responsibility principle, but for interfaces\n",
    "- **D**: Dependency inversion principle\n",
    "  - \"Program to an interface, not to a class\": Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.\n",
    "  - In general, an interface is like a contract, which defines what methods will be available in your objects, with no implementation details.\n"
