    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything before the \"/\" can only be passed positionally (i.e. you can not call the function like ```f(a=1, b=2, ...)```. Everything after the \"/\" but before the \"\\*\" can be passed either positionally or as a keyword, and all the rest are expected to be passed as keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that might be strange at first is that if you are using the keyword arguments (*kwargs*) in your function, you can still pass a keyword with the same name as a positional parameter, e.g.:\n",

    "def my_function(a, b, /, **kwargs):\n",
