However, we might decide to implement a new version of the ```Tower``` class that uses binary search to reduce the time to check if an element is contained in the tower, or that keeps the discs at specific indexes to provide constant lookup time.

    "\n",
    "As mentioned, there's are \"interface\"s in Python, but you can achieve the same result by using abstract classes, which are implemented in the [abc Python module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html). This is what we'll be using to implement \"interfaces\"."
